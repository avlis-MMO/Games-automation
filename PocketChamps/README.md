# Explanation

This script will automate the game pocket champs on android phones, for these to work you must have all the require libraries and be able to connect ur phone to the pc
and copy its screen. And this script was made for the Samsung S20, so may not work for other androids. If the reason is because the buttons selected arent in the same 
spots you can change this to be according to your phone coordinates.

## What will it do?

The script will start runs for you, select the best gadget avaiable for you, get the rewards, start opening the box, and most important will change the time on your phone one day forward to instantly open the box, beacuse the clock of the game is in sync with the clock of the phone.
But after a few runs the game will start to lag a bit and should stop until its back to normal.

## What to do before starting?

For this to work perfectly, you must have the furst box slot free, be on the home screen where the play button is.
As image below.

The other thing is to have only to apps running on the background of your phone, the pocket champ app and the settings app opened in the date and time section, and the 
Automatic date and time box should be unselected. As seen in the images below.
