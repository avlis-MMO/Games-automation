# What is this?

A repository to save all the scripts I wrote to automate some of the games I play, most of the automation is based using openCV or adb, so for this to work 
these two libraries are a must. And you must be able to connect yout phone to the computer to send commands and copy the screen. 
These scripts only work for android phones.
